Poker Calculators
=========
Collection of javascript poker calculators. These are all barebone, hardly styled calculators.

They make use of javascript (not jquery) so they can be used without the need to call an external library.

Being that they are solely JS calculators (and won't function without JS) I've called JS directly on the elements

Calculators included are:
1) Outs Calculator for determining the number of outs you have
2) Pot Odds Calculator for determining if you should continue with the hand
3) Investment Odds Calculator which is a estimated value
4) M-Zone for tournament play
5) Bankroll for determining how much you could afford to lose
